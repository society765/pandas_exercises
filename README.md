# Pandas Exercises

## Comment 

I use this project to practice pandas. I have finished 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 08, 09, 10. 

All below parts of the README are from the original author. Many thanks! 

## Original Readme

Fed up with a ton of tutorials but no easy way to find exercises I decided to create a repo just with exercises to practice pandas.
Don't get me wrong, tutorials are great resources, but to learn is to do. So unless you practice you won't learn.

There will be three different types of files:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Exercise instructions  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Solutions without code  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Solutions with code and comments

My suggestion is that you learn a topic in a tutorial or video and then do exercises.
Learn one more topic and do exercises. If you got the answer wrong, don't go directly to the solution with code.

Suggestions and collaborations are more than welcome. Please open an issue or make a PR. :)
